## Specs
This is the exam project for the Web and Multimedia Technology universitary course. The goal is to create a website from scratch, using only ***DHTML*** for the front end. In addition to the interaction with a database via ***PhP***. <br><br><br>
All the images used in the webiste are taken from <a href="https://unsplash.com/">https://unsplash.com/</a><br><br>
All the gifs used in the website are taken from <a href="https://giphy.com/">https://giphy.com/</a>.<br>
These gifs are used for personal / educational purposes only, ****not for commercial use****. As specified in the <a href="https://support.giphy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360020027752-GIPHY-User-Terms-of-Service">GIPHY User Terms of Service</a>: "[..] you're only allowed to use content that you find on the site in connection with your use of the Services and solely for personal and non-commercial purposes [..]".
<br><br><br>
The repository has two branches, the ***main*** is the one with all the php code for interacting with the DB. The ***static-website*** is the secondary branch, it is just a site template (without PhP code) that can be reached via the url below.
